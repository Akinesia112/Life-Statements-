My Life Statements.

- **If life is an adventure, then why are you here? What are you doing here?**
- Go where you want to go. Traveling the world and starting a company might seem cool, but to you, it feels like burning passion while burying capital (including your life).
- Learn how your idols think—not just their accomplishments.
- Don’t tattoo your company’s brand on your back. That’s not your name.
- Spend more time playing, not working.
- Make good things, with solid materials.
- Decentralize custody, centralize meaning. Spread your attention across different experiences (travel, relationships, crafting), but organize them internally to point to one central question.
- My opinions are as useless as everyone else's.
- Breaking things down into atomic units doesn’t always reveal the essence—just look at college lecture courses.
- Do things that help you think, like acting without overthinking. Thinking is a living exploration, not a technical dissection.
- It's pretty dumb to try building a soul with soulless tools—creation is about struggling toward beauty.
- Don’t use pride to gloss over real conversations.
- XX is / is not the reason I was born into this world.
- Fight back against algorithmically recommended trash.
